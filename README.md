# ntarget

A build system based on modern JavaScript

## Goals

-   **Versatile** · provide primitives instead of built-in support for any particular toolchain
-   **Fast** · always do the minimum work required to build a target
-   **Deterministic** · every build must be replicable
-   **Easy to use** · use modern JavaScript to describe build recipes
